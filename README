This program is used to generate random words and append them to a file.
The words can then be used as placeholder text for a website or a 
document. 

The program was originally made in Python, then ported to C++, then 
ported to C. The final port was done as part of an exercise in
practising craftsmanship and modularity. Both original programs were
made entirely in the main function, so I set out to split it up into
logical steps instead. That produced this version.

I don't currently have any plans which involve this program for the
future, but it may be used in conjunction with other programs, for 
example to generate some text for another script to scan through or 
encode.
